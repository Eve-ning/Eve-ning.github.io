# The 1st Website

This website is the first one I built. I wanted to start with something that was
simple and comfortable enough for me, which lead me to Jekyll. It has quite a
few functionalities, such as MathJax, which is a miracle that is still working!

I don't remember the exact details of it anymore, but it definitely looks fine
for a first website o wo)a. Have a look at it, it contains some of my old
university notes!
