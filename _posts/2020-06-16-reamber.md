![Reamber GUI]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/reamber.png)

osu!mania, is the Rhythm Game I mostly play, and it's also one of the reasons I
first started programming! I was inspired
by [Agka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/64811),
who first created a simple web-tool that normalizes speed. At that time, I used
it a ton to save so much time normalizing live mapped songs, which made me
realise the power of coding.

To challenge myself (and also try out programming)
I wanted to create a tool that aids in level-design (a.k.a. mapping),
I initially created `amber`!

At that time, `amber` was just coded with C++, as a **terminal tool**.
It extends Agka's toolkit to stutters, jumps and more.
As it became an evergrowing toolkit, its limited clunky terminal UI wasn't
breaking even the time-saved and thus I went for a overhaul,
a new effort: `Re:amber`.

`Re:amber`, is built on `Qt`, a GUI building toolkit that I thoroughly enjoyed
using. However, at that time, its only option was C++, so I had to roll with
that ... unfortunately. The choice of programming language became a huge
roadblock in many ways

1. Coding was safer, but slower
2. Compiling was a huge pain (that's why there's no Linux Distribution)

Therefore, every time I want to add a new functionality... it's a few weeks
of time-investment.

Thankfully, it has benefited many mappers, I'm grateful for those who PMed me
that they've made good use of it. Hopefully, it expanded the range of maps that
is possible (without having to resort to Excel).
