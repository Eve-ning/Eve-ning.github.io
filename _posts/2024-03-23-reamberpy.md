`Re:amberPy` is a **Python** package with a similar goal to `Re:amber`. Making
mapping easier for mappers. This extends functionality way further than
what `Re:amber` has done, with the tradeoff that it doesn't have a GUI (yet).
By making this tradeoff, of no GUI and a simpler language, it can now:

- handle most VSRG formats, including: `.osu .sm .ojm .bms .qua`.
- flexible API to (batch) manipulate maps
- work with any OS

On the side, it is also aiming to be a **open-source** library that VSRG
programmers use to improve their Python skills while enjoying the game.
