SDKs should be no more than the sum of the Domain Knowledge and of the chosen
Programming Language.

Users should not be required to learn or compromise by adopting auxiliary
classes or functions beyond this combined scope. Instead, users are expected to
provide only the minimal information required for the SDK to achieve their
goals. To support this, the SDK must provide immediate and precise guidance,
ensuring users can identify and supply correct information at the earliest
possible moment. The feedback loop must be tight, but non-invasive, proactively
detecting and addressing issues at appropriate times during development.
