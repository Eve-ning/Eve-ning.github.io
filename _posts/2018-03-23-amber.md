Ancient C++ CLI of re:amberPy. This is also known as "amber".

This is one of my first ever projects, surprisingly, I started out
(questionably) strong by using C++. Till this day, I'm doubtful if it was the
right choice, though it did feel like a rite of passage in determining if I
truly loved programming.

It's now a relic of what I once used to write in C++.
