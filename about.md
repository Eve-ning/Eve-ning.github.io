build this website.

# About Me

I'm Evening, I do programming, game-level design, and naturally game a lot.

I mostly work on projects around Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Games such as

- [Reamber: A C++ Windows Tool for SV Editing in osu!mania](https://github.com/Eve-ning/reamber)
- [ReamberPy: A Python Toolbox that supports manipulating game files in multiple VSRGs](https://github.com/Eve-ning/reamberpy)
- [Opal: An online ML Collaborative Filtering Model that Predicts Scores](https://github.com/Eve-ning/opal-emb)

Professionally, I'm specializing in Machine Learning Engineering, in which I
bridge the gap between ML Research and Software Engineering. To be honest, it's
quite a generic role I'm taking, I just love programming, and ML is quite hip
these days.


## Tools I use

Some of the core languages/libraries I use:
