Directly utilize CUDA to speed up the processing of GLCM in Python.

<!--more-->

This project is a Python package that provides a CUDA-accelerated implementation
of the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features. The package uses the
CuPy library, to bridge CUDA and Python code, enabling usage of the GPU when
computing GLCM.

This solution, is at least a few thousands times faster than the Scikit-Image
implementation, mainly because of the Python loop. However, the benefits of
using a GPU is highly limited by the fact that it's hard to parallelize the
accumulation function, which is the main bottleneck we faced when implementing.
