ARXScore: Absolute-Relative XGBoost Scorer (Blueprint)

This was one of my first proper tries at **boosting**, as it's one of the faster
and more powerful approaches to Machine Learning. To me, it stands in the gray
area between low effort Machine Learning Models and large scale Deep Neural
Networks: not good, but not bad.

You can read more about it in the documentation in the repository, but this is
still one of my earlier amateur attempts at machine learning :+1:
