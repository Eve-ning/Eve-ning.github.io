An early approach on map difficulty estimation using Deep Neural Networks.

<!--more-->

This is one of the first few "research" efforts I've done. It was one of the key
motivators for me to try out a more research oriented role.

In hindsight, the report is rather hand-wavy, which as expected, won't fly in
the real world. However, the key thing was that I had fun trying to do research!
Please consider the results below with doubts, it's not a robust approach, it's
just a quick college try on research :bulb:
