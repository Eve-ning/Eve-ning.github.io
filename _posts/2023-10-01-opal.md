Opal is a Machine Learning model that uses a Matrix Factorization branch then
a Multi-layered Perceptron branch to learn associations between user and maps.
Then use those learnt associations to predict new scores never before seen.
It uses the idea from [NeuMF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031), also known as
Neural Collaborative Filtering

> Neural collaborative filtering. In Proceedings of the 26th international
> conference on world wide web (pp. 173-182).

It's also dependent on [osu-data](https://github.com/Eve-ning/osu-data) which is
a bash script wrapped in a Python Package. It uses Docker Containers to
automatically downloads the source database data, optimally loads it into a
MySQL container.
