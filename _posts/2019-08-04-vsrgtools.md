vsrgtools is the spin-off version of the amber tool suite, which are
tools for osu!mania level-designers.

<!--more-->

vsrgtools, in short, is an R Lang package that provides a similar toolset to
amber tools. It's best to compare it with re:amberPy, where vsrgtools is simply
the weaker translation of it. Unfortunately, due to my low investment into
R-Lang, it is not well maintained.

Despite that, you can see how R can be used to create a Web App GUI (similar
to Streamlit on Python). It's still live the last time I checked, which is
surprising :+1:
